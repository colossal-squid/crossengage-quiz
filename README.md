# CrossengageQuiz

The assignment I've read was the one available on [https://bitbucket.org/crossengage/quizengage-code-challenge-fe](https://bitbucket.org/crossengage/quizengage-code-challenge-fe)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
I've checked AOT build to actually work. WindowRef injection is a lot simpler than it was in ng4
## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
